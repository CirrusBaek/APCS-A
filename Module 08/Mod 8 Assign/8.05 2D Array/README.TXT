PROJECT TITLE: 8.05 2D Array
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:calculates the range of a projectile with a given angle and velocity.
VERSION or DATE:3/8/23
AUTHORS:

---------------------PMR----------------------
<+s> I was succesfully able to store the speedArray and speedAngle values in a 2d array
by creating a 2d instance of the catapult class. I used for loops to achieve this. I then calculated the distance for
the catapults by using the columns.
<-s> This program was a but difficult for me to understand at first, but I realized that creating a 2d instance would be more
easier for me to code.

I will continue to practice transversing through 2d arrays in the future.
