PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This program 
 * creates different hierarchies of terrains using inheritance(extends) and super calls in constructors.
VERSION or DATE:3/16/23
AUTHORS:

-------------PMR---------------------------------------------------------------------
<+S> I was successful in creating subclasses of the terrain class to create different lands. 
<-s> I had no difficulties with this program.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall, I learned that one class can't have multiple parent classes, but one class can have multiple sub
classes(ex. terrain).
