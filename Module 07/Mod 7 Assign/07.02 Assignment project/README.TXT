 cheesecake flavors.
VERSION or DATE:2/2/23
AUTHORS:


-----------------------------------------PMR-------------------------------------
<+s> I was successful in printing the correct ingredient amounts for each cheesecake object by using an arraylist and oops concepts.
The for loops were easy to execute, and the methods were easy to call using dot notation.
<-s> I struggled a bit with the printf formatting, but eventually got the layout in the end.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the future, I will continue to work on printf formatting because it's a very useful tool, and I want to learn more
about arrays methods.
